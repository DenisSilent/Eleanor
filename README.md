## **Description of the mod:**

Eleanor is a young witch who studies under the guidance of the local wizard, Mr. Rasmodius. She is kinda shy at first, but she'll eventually open up to you (or, at least, that's how her dialogues & events are written). She loves studying and learning new things. Also, note that her past is not one of the best...

### **Features:**

* 1 NPC named Eleanor that:
  * likes studying, learning new things
  * loves nature
  * **is datable but NOT marriable** (until version 1.0.0)
  * **needs SVE; compactible with expansions like Ridgeside Village, East Scrap, Downtown Zuzu, and many more!**

### **Roadmap:**

* ~~0.7.0 - one look only clothes + 1st GitHub release~~ 1.2.2025
* ~~0.7.3 - final mod content before internal testing and debugging~~ 8.2.2025
* ~~0.7.4-beta.7 - final private internal version, synchronization with GitHub and upcoming NexusMods release~~ 13.2.2025
* ~~0.8.0 - wide public release on NexusMods (should be the same date as 0.7.4-beta.7)~~ 14.2.2025
* ~~0.9.0 - dialogues update (dedicated movie dialogues, etc.)~~ 22.3.2025
* 1.0.0 - marriage update
* 1.1.0 - ???
* ~~X.X.X - more sprites & portraits - won't happen any time soon~~ art created and, as of 0.9.0-beta.1 included, by **hezjena2023**!

### **Compatibility with other mods:**

#### **Technical compatibility:**

* Platforms/OS:
  * Windows ✔
  * MacOS ❔ partilly supported; might be compactible, needs confirmation
  * Linux ❔ partilly supported; might be compactible, needs confirmation
  * Mobile - Android/iOS ❌ not supported

#### **Mod compatibility:**

* [SVE](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753) - this mod was created as an add-on NPC, requiring SVE, so it should be fully compatible (there *might* be bugs, as not 100% of the SV or SVE content was tested; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them)
* [RSV](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7286) - should be fully compatible (there might be bugs; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them)
* [ES](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787) - should be fully compatible (there might be bugs; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them)
* Other NPC mods:
  ... I'll be honest - this mod *might or might not* work with NPC mods you use. I expect many bugs with many NPCs; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them. For festivals, I work by LemurKat's method "First in gets priority" which is described [in LemurKat&#39;s blog post about festival overlaps.](https://lemurkat.wordpress.com/2021/11/13/help-theyre-overlapping-at-a-festival/) And as my mod is pretty new, I expect A LOT of festival moves on my side.
  **Eleanor will react to these NPC mods: Always Raining in the Valley, Alecto, Lavril, Lucikiel, RSV, Leilani, Jorts and Jean, Rodney and Yri (incompatible in 1.6).** Also, Eleanor will adapt her dialogues if you use [Rasmodia](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8265)!
* Other mods:
  There shouldn't be any technical incompatibility, but there might be some things that might not be 100% "lore friendly", so compatible, but:
  ...only time will tell...

### **Credits:**

Basics (parts of content.json, manifest.json, now-quite-obsolete mod folder structure) were created with the help of *MissCoriel's NPC Creator*, which is not bad at all, but in my opinion, it is better to do it from some NPC mod you like (I used many NPC mods I play with; as SVE & RSV, but these great mods are so big that their code is not easy to follow at all (ES is in a quite good position, though), so I recommend smaller ones like Jorts and Jean (totally ideal, with combination with this link: [https://stardewmodding.wiki.gg/wiki/Tutorial:_Making_a_Custom_NPC](https://stardewmodding.wiki.gg/wiki/Tutorial:_Making_a_Custom_NPC)), MrGinger (due to his story it is not so easy to follow his code) or this one of course ☻). Anyways, credits to those:

**Eric Barone *"ConcernedApe"*** - extremely big THANK YOU for making & updating Stardew Valley (also a big THANK YOU to everyone who was or is working with him);

**Jessie Plamondon-Willard *"Pathoschild"*** - very big THANK YOU for making SMAPI, Content Patcher,  many more mods and being the *"Modfather"*; also thanks for helping me;

**hezjena2023** - THANK YOU for creating the art for my Eleanor!;

Anyone who was willing to help or ask for help from Stardew Valley Discord (especially from #making-mods-general; many thanks to everyone there). All users that helped me are mentioned in the "changelog.md" file located [in the changelog files](https://github.com/DenisSilent/Eleanor/tree/main/%5BCP%5D%20Eleanor/zzz_dummy%20files/!%20Changelogs);
