By downloading this mod, you automatically agree to this licencing, listed below.
If you want to do something that's not mentioned below, please, ask for permissions! However, if I won't respond within 30 days from your message *and* there is *no* notice about me not being able to respond, the permission is automatically granted, however, you still have to follow the rules below and I reserve the rights to take the permission back after I can respond.

## You can without asking; the only thing I demand is that this mod will be a dependency in your mod's manifest:

* translate this mod (only i18n files - there's nothing in other files; both releasing independently and giving me your translation is possible, I'll prefer the second one; for this the manifest part is changed to NexusMods/other page requirement)
* use this mod as a template for your mod (code can be used, content like dialogues, etc. can not; of course, you don't have to (but you can if you want!) set dependency for my mod in these cases)
* create different sprites/portraits of this mod (but read the [Stardew Valley Character Creator](https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator)'s Terms of Use, just in case)
* edit this mod (for personal usage only; multiple persons edits allowed X the edited mod can't be publicly shared (by that, I mean that you can share the edits through Google Drive or webs like these, but the link can't be publicly shared = can't be publicly found using search engines))
* convert the last (un)official version of the mod to other games
* release unofficial version of this mod after it would be incompatible with some
  SV/SMAPI/CP/SVE version (but it can be only using rules shared [here](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/unofficial-mod-updates.2096/) and [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Mod_compatibility#Creating_an_unofficial_update); copy of those as of 8.10.2024/mod version 0.6.5-beta4 are shared with this mod)

## **You can not:**

* steal/defame/... this mod
* place this mod behind a paywall/monetize in any way any part of this mod (you
  can, however, monetize your mod in any way, even if you get inspired by
  my code)
