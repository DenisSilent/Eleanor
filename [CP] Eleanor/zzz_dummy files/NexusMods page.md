# NPC Eleanor

The NPC Eleanor mod, created by StrojvedouciDenis (a.k.a. DenisSilent or Denis001 (at Discord)) for game Stardew Valley.

## **Description of the mod:**

Eleanor is a young witch that studies at Mr. Rasmodius' tower. She is kinda shy at first, but she'll eventually open up to you (or, at least, that's how her dialogues & events are written).

### **Roadmap**:

* 0.7.5 - whole vanilla NPC graphics
* 0.8.0 - release
* 0.9.0 - marriage
* X.X.X - more sprites & portaites - won't happen any time soon

### **Compactibility with other mods:**

SVE - this mod was created as an add-on NPC for SVE, so it should be fully compactible (there *might* be bugs, as not 100% of the SV or SVE content was tested; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them)
RSV - should be fully compactible (there might be bugs; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them)
ES - should be fully compactible (there might be bugs; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them)
Other NPC mods:
... I'll be honest - this mod *might or might not* work with NPC mods you use. I expect many bugs with many NPC's; if you report them, I'll try my best to fix them. For festivals, I work by LemurKat's method "First in gets priority" that is described here: [https://lemurkat.wordpress.com/2021/11/13/help-theyre-overlapping-at-a-festival/](https://lemurkat.wordpress.com/2021/11/13/help-theyre-overlapping-at-a-festival/). And as my mod is pretty young, I expect A LOT of festival moves on my side.
Other mods:
...only time will tell...

### **Credits:**

Basics (parts of content.json, manifest.json, mod folder structure) were created with help of *MissCoriel's NPC Creator*, which is not bad at all, but in my opinion it is better to do it from some NPC mod you like (I used many NPC mods I play with; as SVE & RSV, but these great mods are so big that their code is not easy to follow at all (ES is in quite good position), so I recommend smaller ones like Jorts and Jean (totally ideal, with combination with this link: [https://stardewmodding.wiki.gg/wiki/Tutorial:_Making_a_Custom_NPC](https://stardewmodding.wiki.gg/wiki/Tutorial:_Making_a_Custom_NPC)), MrGinger (due to his story it is not so easy to follow his code) or this one of course â˜»). So credits to those:

*Eric Barone "ConcernedApe"* - extermely big THANK YOU for making & updating Stardew Valley (also big THANK YOU for everyone who was or is working with him)

Pathoschild - very big THANK YOU for making SMAPI, Content Patcher, and many more mods (technically, the whole new method of SV modding exist because of your work, and it is easier to mod and to use instead of that method by changing game's .xnb files); also thanks for helping me

FlashShifter - big THANK YOU for making Stardew Valley Expanded

Anyone who was willing to help or ask for help from Stardew Valley Discord (especially from #making-mods-general; many thanks to everyone there). All users that helped me are mentioned in "changelog.md" file located in ".../[CP] Eleanor/zzz_dummy files/changelog.md"

Portaites for Eleanor are made using [https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator](https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator) and edited so they could be used as portaites for NPC. However, as the program's Terms of Use define, I do not claim any rights for these images (not that I would even want them, but...). Also, as the program and its images are shared under Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, images (Eleanor's portraites) will stay licenced with Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, no matter the other mod files's licencing.

#### **Permissons:**

##### You can (without getting permissions; only thing I demand is that this mod will be a depedency for your mod (set at NexusMods, also can be in manifest)):

* translate this mod (only i18n files - there's nothing in other files; both releasing independently and giving me your translation is possible)
* use this mod as a template for your mod (code can be used, content like dialogues, etc. can not)
* create different sprites/portrates of this mod (but read the [https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator](https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator)'s Terms of Use, just in case)
* edit this mod (for personal usage only!)
* release unofficial version of this mod after it would be incompactible with some Stardew Valley version (but it can be only using rules shared at [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/unofficial-mod-updates.2096/](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/unofficial-mod-updates.2096/) and [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Mod_compatibility#Creating_an_unofficial_update](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Mod_compatibility#Creating_an_unofficial_update); copy of those as of 8.10.2024/mod version 0.6.5-beta4 are shared with this mod)

##### **You can not:**

steal/dehonest/... this mod

place this mod behind a paywall/monetize in any way any part of this mod (you can, however, monetize your mod in any way, even if you inspired by my code)

##### **Warning for mod authors:**

This NPC mod *might* (I tried my best to not include anything, but...) include parts of content from other mods. You may not worry, there is NO content like dialogues/events/etc. in this mod, but many things from many different mods were used as an template so I could make this mod working.

However, everything that's NOT created by me is subject to the rights and/or licenses of other authors. If the author doesn't agree with including their content in this mod, please contact me immediately on Nexus, and I'll remove the content from my mod (also the mod will be inaccessible for the time I'll be solving that). Please, do not report me/my mod for violating Your rights to Your content, as we can resolve this issue peacefully. I value Your contributions to the community of Stardew Valley and/or other games, and I can guarantee that I do NOT want to steal/dehonest/... Your work.
